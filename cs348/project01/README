CS 348 - Project 1

http://www-cgi.cs.purdue.edu/cgi-bin/mbmccorm/348/index.php

This project was written in PHP and can be found at http://www-cgi.cs.purdue.edu/cgi-bin/mbmccorm/348/index.php. To run this application on your own account, you will need to set up your www-cgi.cs.purdue.edu share. Once that is complete, simply copy these files to your www-cgi share at /p/www-cgi/cgi-bin/YOUR_USERNAME/ and modify the include/config.php file with your database connection information and the RootDirectory.

You do not need to compile this application, the server will compile this code at runtime. Just copy this to your www-cgi share and visit the site on your web browser. You can also just access it from my share.

If you run into any problems, please send me an email.

The SQL scripts to drop, create, and populate the database are in the db folder. The ERD for the database is also in this folder.
