# Purdue University - Computer Science

This repository contains the complete collection of my undergraduate [Computer Science][1] coursework at [Purdue University][2]. I officially enrolled in the CS program in Fall 2010 and I graduated in Fall 2012, completing the required coursework in two years.

## Courses

The courses that I took followed the Computer Science department's [undergraduate core curriculum][3] as well as the [Software Engineering track][4]'s curriculum. Here is the list of courses that are included in this repository:

*   CS 180 - Problem Solving and Object-Oriented Programming
*   CS 240 - Programming in C
*   CS 250 - Computer Architecture
*   CS 251 - Data Structures and Algorithms
*   CS 252 - Systems Programming
*   CS 307 - Software Engineering
