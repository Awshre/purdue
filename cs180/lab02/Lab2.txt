Spend a few minutes browsing this program and try to answer the following questions prior to compiling it.



1. List all classes used explicitly methods in this program.

Scanner
CheckPrimality


2. List all methods defined as well as used in this program.

isItPrime()
main()
println()
nextLong()
nextLine()
currentTimeMillis()


3. For each method, list its return type.

void
void
void
long
string
long 


4. What is the purpose of the Scanner class?

To retrieve input from the user.


5. What does the println() method do?

Prints a string of text to the console.


6. Can you locate the constructor for CheckPrimality?

CheckPrimality does not have a constructor.


7. List all the primitive types used in this program.

long
string
int
bool


8. After having browsed the program, can you explain the method used here to check for primality?

The CheckPrimality program will prompt the user for a positive integer, check for errors, and then 
call the isItPrime() method. This method will check if it is 1 or 2, printing the necessary results,
and then begin a loop to divide by 2 to determine if it is a prime number. The program will then
print the proper output including the time it took to execute this method.


9. What differences and similarities do you notice in the naming of classes methods, and variables? 

Variables that were declared inside of the CheckPrimality class are available to all methods in the
CheckPrimality class. All methods declared in the CheckPrimality class are available to the other 
methods in the CheckPrimality class.


10. Compile and run the program. 
 
When asked for a number input the following strings (one on each request):
 
 104,395,301
 
 1234560
 
 123gg22
 
 -3
 
 0
 
What happens when you type a non-number?

You receive the "Sorry, input not a number or is to large, try again." error message.
