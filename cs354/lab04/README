Features that work:
- sendb()
- receiveb()

Features that do not work:
- N/A

Additional information:
- Sending process queue is stored on the process table entry, similar to how semaphores do
- This makes it easy to enqueue and dequeue sending processes and does not require searching a global queue
- If receiving process completes execution while a sender is blocked, sendb() returns SYSERR and continues
