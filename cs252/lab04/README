Lab 4

Part 1

In Step 3, the program continuously creates new threads in a while(1) loop. These threads then print out the characters 'A', 'B', and 'C' continuously in no particular order until the program is killed with SIGINT.

In Step 5, the program never reaches the portion of code where the threads are created. Instead, it prints the 'C' character in a while(1) loop until the program is killed with SIGINT.
