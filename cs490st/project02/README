Project 2


To setup this program on your machine, run the `make` command. This will build the necessary executables.

To run the first part of this project, run `./run.sh ./sample1` or `./run.sh ./sample2`. 

To run the secound part of this project, run `chess_runner`. By default, this tests the sample1 file. You can change this by modifying the SAMPLE_NUMBER value in the chess_runner.c file. Don't forget to rebuild the project by running `make`.

If necessary, you can unable debugging output by uncommenting the #define SHOW_DEBUG line in the chess.cpp file. Don't forget to rebuild the project by running `make`.
